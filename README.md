# FinTrack Dashboard

FinTrack is a responsive and interactive financial dashboard built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Transaction Rendering**: Loop through transaction data and render clean `TransactionRow` components dynamically.
- **Summary Dashboard**: Display totals and percentage changes for balances, credits, debits, and transaction counts using the `DashboardSummary` interface.
- **Sortable Transactions**: Users can sort transactions by date by clicking on the arrow on the table to switch between ascending and descending.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout with Tailwindâ€™s `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, and `xl:` breakpoints.
- **Mobile-First Header**: The header is fully responsive with icons and profile image that adapt to smaller screens.
- **Loading & Empty States**: Built-in `<Loading />` and `<NoData />` components enhance user experience during data fetching and when no data is available.

## ðŸ§  State Management

The dashboard manages:

- **Active Tab** â€“ Tracks whether the user is viewing "Overview" or "Transactions".
- **Sort Direction** â€“ Allows toggling between ascending and descending sorting for transactions based on dates.
- **Loading & Empty States** â€“ State-driven rendering of `<Loading />` or `<NoData />` components.
